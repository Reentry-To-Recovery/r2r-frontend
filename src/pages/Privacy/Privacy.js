          If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies,
          please contact us via our Contact Us link and we will try to resolve
          your concerns. Because of federal law, we are not permitted to
          knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age
          of thirteen without the consent of that child&#8217;s parent or
          guardian. The statements in this Privacy Policy about our collection
          and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of
          personal information from children under the age of thirteen. Some
          elements of our Services such as signing up for our Services require
          the submission of a payment card number along with personal
          information in connection with a purchase; other elements of our
          Services require the submission of personal information to access or
          use the Services. Except in certain cases where limited contact
          information may be collected and not retained, these elements of our
          Services are not available to children under the age of thirteen. If a
          child who we know to be under the age of thirteen and for whom we have
          not received parental consent attempts to utilize a service on our
          Services which is not available to children, he/she will not be able
          to access it and may receive a message which relays that he/she is not
          eligible for such feature.
